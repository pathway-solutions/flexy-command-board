# Flexy Command Board (Static Dashboard)

A lightweight, mobile-friendly dashboard that runs as a static site (no build tools).
- Tailwind via CDN
- Alpine.js for interactivity
- Data stored in `assets/data.json` (and decisions cached in browser localStorage)

## Quick Start
Open `index.html` in your browser.

## Edit Data
Update `assets/data.json`. Refresh the page to see changes.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a public repo (e.g., `flexy-command-board`).
2. Upload all files/folders from this directory.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Branch: `main`** and **Folder: `/ (root)`**.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes; your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Netlify / Vercel
Drag-and-drop this folder to Netlify, or create a new project in Vercel selecting this repo. No build command needed.
